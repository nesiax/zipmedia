lingua is the prefered option.

i18n.sh is a script that populates everything.

lingua.cfg is the configuration

./i18n.sh # to create everything. (init or update)

which is basically the same as run:

python setup.py extract_messages

./i18n.sh es # to create i18n for 'es' (init or update, update, compile)

which is basically the same as run:

python setup.py init_catalog -l es

python setup.py compile_catalog
